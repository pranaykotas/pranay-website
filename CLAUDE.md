## How to add content

### 1. Blog post

Create a new `.qmd` file in `blog/`. Filename becomes the URL slug.

```yaml
---
title: "Your Title"
date: "2025-03-01"
description: "One-line summary shown in the listing"
author: "Pranay Kotasthane"
categories:
  - Semiconductor Geopolitics   # use one or more from the canonical list below
---

Your article text here.
```

**Canonical categories (use these consistently):**
- `Semiconductor Geopolitics`
- `Critical Minerals`
- `AI Geopolitics`
- `Technology Policy`
- `Public Policy`
- `Public Finance`
- `Political Economy`
- `India Foreign Policy`

**Optional: pull quote in right margin**
```markdown
::: {.pullquote .column-margin}
A sentence worth highlighting.
:::
```

**Optional: source attribution in left margin** (if the post also appeared in a publication)
```markdown
::: {.source-note .column-margin}
**Mint**
Originally published as part of [The Intersection](url) column.
:::
```

---

### 2. Op-ed — external link only (freely accessible)

Add 5 lines to `op-eds/op-eds.yml`:

```yaml
- title: "Your Article Headline"
  date: 2025-03-01
  description: "The Hindu"
  path: "https://thehindu.com/..."
  categories: [Geopolitics]
```

---

### 3. Op-ed — with full text or excerpt (paywalled content)

Create a new `.qmd` file in `op-eds/`. It will appear in the op-eds listing and also get its own page.

```yaml
---
title: "Your Article Headline"
date: "2025-03-01"
description: "Mint"
categories: [Geopolitics]
---
```

At the top of the body, add the attribution block:

```html
```{=html}
<div class="op-ed-source">
  <div class="op-ed-source-label">Originally published in</div>
  <div class="op-ed-source-pub">Mint</div>
  <a href="https://livemint.com/..." class="op-ed-source-link" target="_blank">Read original →</a>
</div>
```
```

Then paste the article text. For excerpts only, add at the bottom:

```markdown
::: {.read-more-box}
*Excerpt only — the article continues at the original publication.*

[Read the full article at Mint →](https://livemint.com/...){.btn .btn-primary target="_blank"}
:::
```

### 4. Publication / paper

Add to `publications/publications.yml`:

```yaml

  date: 2025-03-01
  description: "Takshashila Institution · with Co-author Name"
  path: "https://doi.org/..."
  categories: [Technology Policy]
```

---

:::
::: {.g-col-9}
### Book Title

## Workflow: Obsidian → personal site → Takshashila

1. Write in Obsidian
2. Export/convert to `.qmd`
3. Save to `blog/` (or `op-eds/`) in this repo — this is your **canonical copy**
4. Copy the same file to `~/OurWebsite/` if it's also going on the Takshashila site
5. Run `quarto render` and deploy
